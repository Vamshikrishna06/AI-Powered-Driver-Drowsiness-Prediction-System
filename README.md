# AI-Powered Driver Drowsiness Prediction System

## Overview

**DriveSafe Vision** is a computer vision–based system designed to detect driver drowsiness in real time to prevent road accidents. The system uses a webcam to monitor the driver’s facial features, particularly eye movements and blinking patterns, and generates alerts when signs of fatigue or drowsiness are detected.

## Features

* Real-time driver face and eye detection
* Drowsiness detection based on eye closure and blink duration
* Instant alert system (sound or visual warning)
* Continuous monitoring using live camera feed
* Lightweight and real-time performance

## Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, Dlib / Mediapipe
* **Concepts:** Computer Vision, Facial Landmark Detection, Real-Time Image Processing

## Usage

1. Run the application to start webcam monitoring.
2. The system continuously detects the driver’s face and eye movements.
3. If prolonged eye closure is detected, an alert is triggered to warn the driver.

## Applications

* Road safety and accident prevention
* Smart vehicle safety systems
* Driver monitoring solutions for transportation industries
