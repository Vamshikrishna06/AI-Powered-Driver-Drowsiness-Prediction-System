# DriverGuard-AI-Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
DriveSafe Vision is a computer vision–based system designed to detect driver drowsiness in real time to prevent road accidents. The system uses a webcam to monitor the driver’s facial features, particularly eye movements and blinking patterns, and generates alerts when signs of fatigue or drowsiness are detected.
